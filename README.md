## Synopsis

This repository has code to convert an **imscc** file to a folder with all the content in the defined folder structure.
Every imscc file will have the following,
* A list of folders - Each folder has just one file inside it.
* An xml (imsmanifest.xml) - This file contains information about the folder structure for all files. It also contains some metadata about the individual files.
* A folder named resources - It contains some files which were originally shared as resources in the course.
